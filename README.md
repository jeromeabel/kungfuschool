I am developing a website for a Kung Fu school located in La Rochelle, France. The current website is outdated and does not reflect current best practices in web design.

My work involves designing and developing a complete redesign of the website, with a new design, to provide a quality user experience with the best performance. Additionally, the idea is to create a software solution that integrates other services such as content management, registration, and learning tracking.
